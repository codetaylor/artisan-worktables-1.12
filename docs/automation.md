# Automation

Artisan Worktables allows slot-locking for partial automation.

A full automation solution is planned.

## Partial Automation

When slot-locked, items can be inserted into a table's crafting grid.

* Worktable:
    * Top -> crafting grid if slot-locking is enabled
    * Sides -> crafting grid if slot-locking is enabled
* Workstation:
    * Top -> secondary crafting ingredient slots
    * Sides -> crafting grid slots if slot-locking is enabled
* Workshop:
    * Top -> secondary crafting ingredient slots
    * Sides -> crafting grid slots if slot-locking is enabled

Fluid can be inserted into any side of any table.

Items are not allowed to be extracted from the crafting result slot because this is not meant as a solution for full automation.
