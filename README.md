### Artisan Worktables

Six themed worktables with a tool slot.

This mod is designed for modpack makers. It contains only example recipes and is intended to be used with CraftTweaker. JEI integration is supported.

Recipes for the worktables are like the vanilla crafting recipes (shaped, shapeless) except they require a tool and tool durability cost to be specified. Tools go into the extra slot in the table and remain in the table between crafts. The tables will also retain their contents when closed, but not when broken.

Vanilla crafting table recipes are not supported in any table and there are currently no plans to do so.

Depends on the library mod Athenaeum.

Each worktable includes an extra slot for a tool item.

#### Recipes

No recipes are included with this mod. It is intended that you use CraftTweaker to supply your own recipes for making and using the worktables.
